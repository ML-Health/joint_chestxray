## MIMIC-CXR

We have experimented this algorithm on [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/), which is a large publicly available dataset of chest radiographs in DICOM format with free-text radiology reports. The dataset contains 377,110 images corresponding to 227,835 radiographic studies performed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA.

# Instructions
1. Set up the conda environment using `conda_environment.yml.` You might want to remove the pip dependencies
   if that is creating an issue for you. You can manually install the spacy and scispacy dependencies using
     `pip install spacy` and `pip install scispacy.` Read `https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/` for more
     information on scispacy.
